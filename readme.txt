If you still need support visit our support forums or email us at info(@).premiumcoding.com= How to change size of banner ads (images)? =Simply set parameter width and height to desired value. Or you can also set size in the shortcode.= My theme/site appears not to like this plugin. It's not displaying correctly. =There are a number of things that may prevent Wordpress-falling-snow from displaying or cause it to display a short message about how it needs the Flash plugin.* In 99% of all cases where this happens the issue is caused by markup errors in the page where the plugin is used. Please validate your blog using [validator.w3.org](http://validator.w3.org) and fix any errors you may encounter.* Older versions had issues with PHP 5.2 (or better). This has been fixed, so please upgrade to the latest version.* The plugin requires Flash Player 9 or better and javascript. Please make sure you have both.= I'd like to change something in the Flash movie, will you release the .fla? =Flash version of the file is currently available here: http://activeden.net/item/xml-falling-snow/60796 .If plugins gets a lot of downloads I will make it available for free on Wordpress.= Some characters are not showing up =Because of the way Flash handles text, only Latin characters are supported in the current version. This is due to a limitation where in order to be able to animate text fields smoothly the glyphs need to be embedded in the movie. The Flash movie's source code is available for download through Subversion. Doing so will allow you to create a version for your language. There's a text field in the root of the movie that you can use to embed more characters. If you change to another font, you'll need to edit the Tag class as well.== Screenshots ==1.
